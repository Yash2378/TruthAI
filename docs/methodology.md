# Methodology for Truth AI

## Research Approach

1. **Literature Review**:
    - Conduct a comprehensive review of research in the areas of AI fairness, transparency, and truth-seeking models.
    - Review key texts like *Unmasking AI* and other academic papers.

2. **Data Collection**:
    - Gather datasets that can be used to test the truth-seeking capabilities of AI models.
    - Ensure that datasets are diverse and representative of global populations.

3. **Model Development**:
    - Begin with existing frameworks (e.g., reinforcement learning, supervised learning) and adapt them to prioritize fairness and transparency.
    - Develop custom algorithms that can help AI discern between truth and misinformation.

## Design Considerations

- **Bias Detection**: Integrate methods to detect and mitigate biases at every stage of the AI lifecycle.
- **Transparency**: Ensure that models can explain their decisions, allowing humans to understand how conclusions are reached.
- **Fairness**: Design AI systems that serve all communities equitably, with special attention to marginalized groups.
