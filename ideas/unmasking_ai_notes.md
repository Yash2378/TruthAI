# Notes on *Unmasking AI* by Joy Buolamwini

## Key Themes

1. **Bias in AI Systems**:
    - One of the core arguments in the book is that AI systems often inherit the biases of their creators, leading to unfair outcomes.
    - We must develop frameworks that can detect and mitigate these biases.

2. **Fairness, Accountability, Transparency (FAT)**:
    - AI should be designed with fairness, accountability, and transparency at its core.
    - How do we design AI systems that uphold these principles?

3. **Impact on Marginalized Communities**:
    - AI systems disproportionately affect marginalized communities when biases are present.
    - **Truth AI** must ensure that its models serve all communities equitably.

## Inspiration for Truth AI

- **Truth AI** will prioritize fairness and transparency in its models by:
    - Designing algorithms that explain their decision-making processes.
    - Ensuring that data used in AI systems is diverse and representative of global populations.
    - Focusing on mitigating biases in AI systems at every step of the development process.

## Next Steps

- Explore how existing bias-detection algorithms work and adapt them for **Truth AI**.
- Begin researching existing truth-seeking models and how they align with the principles in *Unmasking AI*.
