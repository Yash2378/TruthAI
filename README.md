# TruthAI
Mitigating Bias in Artificial Intelligence

## Overview

**Truth AI** is an ambitious research-driven project that seeks to understand and implement AI systems capable of discerning objective truth. Through a blend of heavy research, philosophical inquiry, and practical machine learning, we aim to build models that can reason about complex, global-level ethical and moral questions.

This repository will serve as the foundation for world-class AI research, drawing from a wide array of resources, starting with ideas inspired by *Unmasking AI* by Joy Buolamwini.

## Key Objectives

- Investigate how AI systems can discern truth in a world filled with misinformation.
- Explore the ethical and philosophical dimensions of AI and truth.
- Create machine learning models that prioritize fairness, transparency, and accountability.

## Initial Focus

Our initial research draws from *Unmasking AI* by Joy Buolamwini, focusing on AI's societal implications, biases, and ethical concerns. This will serve as a foundation for how **Truth AI** approaches the global understanding of truth.

## Structure

- **Ideas**: A place to collect research ideas and thoughts.
- **Research**: Summaries and insights from research papers and related projects.
- **Code**: Prototypes and code that begin to implement truth-seeking AI systems.
- **Documentation**: Details of methodologies, research findings, and future directions.
